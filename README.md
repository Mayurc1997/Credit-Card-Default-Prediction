# Credit-Card-Default-Prediction 💳

## 🪄 About:
This is an End-to-End Machine Learning project with deployment. The project aims at developing a model and predicting the Credit card Defaulter based on his past 6 months transaction information.

## 🏋🏻‍♂️ Motivation: 
As we are seeing with the growing number of credit card users, banks & credit card companies are facing an increase in credit card default rate. This increase in defaults creates much impact to the financial companies along with the cardholders and pulls them to losses. As such, data analytics can provide solutions to manage the current phenomenon and management of credit defaults. This project discusses the implementation of a model which predicts if a given credit card holder has a probability of defaulting in the following month, using their demographic data like (age, gender, marital status) and behavioural data from the past 6 months

## 📈 DataSet:
In the dataset we have 25 columns which reflect various attributes of the customer. The target column is default.payment.next.month which tells whether a person will default or not. In this dataset, we have information on default payments, demographic factors, credit data, history of payment, and bill statements of credit card holders from April 2005 to September 2005.

# CONCLUSION
* In this paper, Machine learning technique like Logistic regression, XGBoost, SVC and Random forest were used to detect the fraud in credit card system. 
* Sensitivity, Specificity, accuracy and error rate are used to evaluate the performance for the proposed system. The accuracy for logistic regression, XGBoost, SVC and random forest classifier are 79%,86%,82% and 86% respectively. 
* By comparing all the three method, found that random forest classifier is better than the logistic regression and decision tree. XGBoost provided us the best results giving us a recall of 85% percent(meaning out of 100 defaulters 85 will be correctly caught by XGBoost).
