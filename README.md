# ML-Classification-Credit-Card-Default-Prediction
This project is the third capstone project we've done in our Almabetter Data science curriculam. All the models we have developed in this project will be heavily based on classification since we have to predict a binary dependent variable which is whether a customer will default on his/her credit card

# Problem Description​

This project is aimed at predicting the case of customers default payments in Taiwan. From the perspective of risk management, the result of predictive accuracy of the estimated probability of default will be more valuable than the binary result of classification - credible or not credible clients. We can use the K-S chart to evaluate which customers will default on their credit card payments​
